Over on the [Rackspace Blog](http://www.rackspace.com/blog), we've announced
that we are now offering support to developers writing applications on our cloud
infrastructure:

We take customer support pretty seriously around here. Our philosophy is to
include super valuable and responsive support with all our offers. For example,
when you’re a customer and find out you’re going on national TV to pitch your
product, we’ll be there to help with architecting and operating the situation
at no additional cost. This is clearly not the standard level of support in the
cloud space where even the most basic support costs a lot more on top of core
cloud costs. Starting today, we take this already high standard to a new level
with the launch of Rackspace Developer Support, an extension of our Fanatical
Support specifically for developers.

Rackspace Developer Support marks the first time we will officially support your
application code. When you’re programming your application to interact with the
Rackspace Cloud powered by OpenStack, we want to make sure it is as easy as
possible. We offer Software Development Kits for the world’s most popular
programming languages. Right now, this includes PHP, Java, Python, Ruby and .Net.
We are also working on node.js, which we hope to release soon.
