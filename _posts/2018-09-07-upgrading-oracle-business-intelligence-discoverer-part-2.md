### Introduction

This two-part blog series covers the steps required to install or upgrade
Discoverer within an existing E-Business Suite (EBS) R12 instance.
[Part 1](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/upgrading-oracle-business-intelligence-discoverer-part-1/)
discussed the installation of the software required for the Discoverer 11.1.1.7
upgrade. This blog, part 2, covers the details of integration and the Discoverer
End User Layers (EUL) upgrade.

### Integration with Discoverer 11g

This section describes how to integrate e-Business Suite R12 with Discoverer 11g
by using the database connector (dbc) file, which uses a **.dbc** extension, and
the `tnsnames.ora` configuration.

On your Discoverer node, include the tnsnames entry to connect to your EBS R12
database in file `$ORACLE_INSTANCE/config/tnsnames.ora`.

Use the same entry that exists in the `tnsnames.ora` file on your Oracle
E-Business Suite Release 12 application tier server node. The database name must
match the two_task entry in the dbc file.


### Upgrade or create Discoverer EUL

If you already have an existing Discoverer End User Layer, you may need to to
upgrade. The upgrade steps depend on your Discoverer version.  See the following
sections for details.

#### Existing EUL and Discoverer 10.1.2

If you have an existing Discoverer EUL and it is from Discoverer 10.1.2, you are
not required to upgrade. Discoverer Version 11.1.1 uses the same EUL version as
Discoverer 10.1.2. The dbc file is not transferred during the upgrade. After the
upgrade, you must copy the dbc file manually.

#### Existing EUL and version older than Discoverer 10.1.2

If you have an existing Discoverer EUL and its version predates Discoverer
10.1.2, upgrade it to Discoverer 11g by using the following commands on the
standalone application server where Oracle Fusion Middleware Discoverer 11g is
installed:

    $ source $ORACLE_INSTANCE/Discoverer/Discoverer_<ias-instance>/util/discenv.sh
    $ $ORACLE_HOME/bin/eulapi -CONNECT <EUL User>/<Password>@<db> -AUTO_UPGRADE

#### Create new EUL for Discoverer 11.1.1

If you donâ€™t have an existing EUL, you must create one for new Discoverer 11.1.1.
Fresh installations of E-Business Suite r12 Vision database does contain a
pre-installed Discoverer EUL, but other versions do not come with the EUL.

Run the following command to create an EUL:

    % sqlplus /NOLOG
     SQL> connect sys/<sys_password> as sysdba
     SQL> create tablespace DISCOVERER datafile \
     '[DB_ORACLE_HOME]/dbf/discoverer01.dbf' size 200M reuse \
     extent management local uniform size 128K;
     SQL> /
    Statement Processed












Use the following steps for the Oracle WebLogic Server 11gR1 (10.3.6) installation.

1. Run the following command to start the installation:

      <JDK_PATH>/bin/java -d64 -jar -Djava.io.tmpdir=<temp_dir_loc> ./wls1036_generic.jar -log=<loc/filename>

2. Click **Next** on the **Welcome** screen.

3. Create the new Middleware home by specifying the location.

4. Provide Oracle support credentials (if required).

5. Choose the install type, either typical (recommended) or custom.

6. Select local JDK installed, as shown in the following image.

#### RCU installation

The RCU download package should be about 350 MB. This utility creates two
new users and three new tablespaces, which are used to store metadata for
Middleware and Discoverer.

Use the following steps for the installation process:

1. Click **Next** on the **Welcome** screen.

2. Choose **Create** to create the repository.

3. Provide the database connection details.

4. Select **Create new prefix**. Provide the prefix name and select the component,
   such as **Discoverer**, under the Portal & BI label.

5. Enter the schema password.

6. Ensure that the correct default and temporary (temp) tablespaces are showing.
   If the tablespaces are incorrect, modify them.  The following image shows
   this step:
