here are many Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) solutions
available for organizational Single Sign On (SSO) and user management,
including Oracle&reg; Internet Directory (OID), Microsoft Active Directory
(AD), and many other systems. When you have multiple implementations, it can
be difficult to manage and use them all. In this blog post, you'll learn how
to create a view that you can use to manage all of your enterprise's LDAP
implementations.

### Introduction

This blog post provides an overview of a cost effective way to access
all of your existing LDAP solutions and create a view-like object that you
can use to get data from your various LDAP sources. The following image
illustrates how to use Oracle Virtual Directory (OVD) to create a view over all
of the LDAP applications that an organization uses.

OVD is a simple solution that can be used to simplify the use of multiple data sources (such as OID, AD, and other sources) to create a single virtual view that enables you to access all enterprise LDAP sources. The best thing about using OVD is that it doesn’t need any change in an existing structure on a source. It also supports a diverse set of clients such as web applications and portals. It can also connect to directories, databases, and web services, as shown in the following image:

OVD provides Internet and industry-standard LDAP and XML views of existing enterprise identity information, without synchronizing or moving data from its native locations. This accelerates the deployment of applications and reduces costs by eliminating the need to constantly adapt those applications to a changing identity landscape as user populations are added, changed, or removed. As the name suggests, this is a virtual directory, which acts as a view of several OIDs or even ADs (if needed). All of the data used through OVD is transparent to users. It appear sas though it is coming from a single OID,  thereby simplifying usage of multiple OIDs and ADs in programs or in other software such as OAM.

The view(s) type functionality of OVD is achieved by creating Adapters. It can be defined by using the following:

- Target Distinguished Name (DN), which needs to be kept in OVD
- Source Hostname
- Source OID/AD port
- Source DN, which needs to be mapped to the target DN

**Note**: You can define as many adapters as you would like and can connect them to multiple OID’s/AD’s simultaneously.

Steps to define an adapter:

1. Launch ODSM ‘http://<Hostname>:7005/odsm’.
2. Connect to OVD on ‘<Hostname>:8899’. (The Default Port for OVD is 8899.)
3. Select the **Adapter** tab.
4. Press the **New Adapter** button and proceed ()
5. Create a new adapter named **OIDUsers** and ‘Adapter Type’ as ‘LDAP’ (We have
   DB Adapters and custom Adapters as well) , Leave rest of the fields as
   default.
6. Provide connection details for the source LDAP (in our case OID), such as the
   Host, port, Username (Server proxy Bind DN) & Password to access the
   source. In the below example 127.0.0.1 was provided as both OID and OVD
   resides on the same host.
7. Test the connection on the next screen.
8. Provide the source OU (Remote Base) and counterpart of the same for OVD, by
   which the OU will be used when we use this OVD. Leave all other fields as
   default.
9. Review all of the details on the summary page and press **Finish**.

Now after this adapter creation if you use the virtual directory container (Adapter) ‘ou=OIDUsers,dc=***,dc=ovd’, it automatically calls to ‘cn=Users, dc=***,dc=oid’ from the following screen.

Similar way we can define these adapters for different versions of OIDs, Microsoft ADs, etc. and utilize the OVD as a source of data for different web services, which erases the complexity to program differently for all of the different source of information for which OVD is action like a virtual view.

### Conclusion

OVD can help you use all of your existing LDAP solutions in a cost effective
way. It creates a view-like structure that doesn't require any changes to the
existing layout of technologies that an organization uses. It easily connects
to diverse applications and databases and it's simple to implement. Have you
