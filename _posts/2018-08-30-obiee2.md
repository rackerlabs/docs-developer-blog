In [Part 1](https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/obiee1/) of this two-part
series, we discussed some tips for resolving common issues with Oracle&reg;
Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE). In Part 2, we share two
additional OBIEE tips.

### Introduction

These tips come from our first-hand experiences with our own projects and with
troubleshooting customer queries. If you're a middleware administrator, you
can leverage these tips in your routine work to boost efficiency.

### Tip 1: Add a custom logo to OBIEE Analytics

Every administrator is required to customize their OBIEE logo. After OBIEE
installation is complete the default Oracle logo appears on the OBIEE
Analytics page, as shown in the following image.

logo]({% asset_path 2018-08-30-obiee-2/picture1.png %})

The Oracle logo also appears on the login page, as shown in the following
image.

![]({% asset_path 2018-08-30-obiee-2/picture2.png %})

To customize the logo in OBIEE Analytics 11g, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the environment where OBIEE is installed.
2. Navigate to the following path to change the logo for home page:

   **$FMW_HOME/user_projects/domains/DR_domain/servers/bi_server1/tmp/_WL_user/analytics_11.1.1/7dezjl/war/res/s_Skyros/master**

    The current logo file is **oracle_logo.png**.

4. Rename your custom image to **oracle_logo.png**.
5. At the file path that you followed in step 2, replace the default image
   with your custom image.

    **Note**: We recommend that you use the default dimensions for your custom
    logo. For OBIEE 11.1.1.7, the dimensions should be 119 x 25 pixels. For
    OBIEE 11.1.1.9, logo images should be 104 x 14 pixels.

6. Restart Oracle Process Manager (OPMN) services.
7. Clear the browser cache and verify that your changes have taken effect.

After you've restarted OPMN services you see your custom image on the login
and home pages of OBIEE Analytics, as shown in the following images.

### Tip 2: Customize the banner text in OBIEE Analytics

Oracle's default banner text in OBIEE Analytics simply says "Business
Intelligence," as shown in the following images:

![The default banner text on the login
page]({% asset_path 2018-08-30-obiee-2/picture5.png %})

![The default banner text on the home
page]({% asset_path 2018-08-30-obiee-2/picture6.png %})

You can change the banner text in OBIEE Analytics by using the following steps:

1. Log in to the machine where OBIEE is installed.
2. Navigate to the following path:

    **/FMW_HOME/Oracle_BI1/bifoundation/web/msgdb/l_en/messages**
3. Search for the XML file named **productmessages.xml** and make a backup of
   it before you edit it.
5. In the original file, scroll to the following line and customize the text
   between the `<TEXT>` and `</TEXT>` tags to suit your needs:

    `<WebMessage name="kmsgHeaderBIBrandName"><TEXT>Business Intelligence</TEXT></WebMessage>`
6. Save the file.
7. Restart all OBIEE services.
8. Clear the browser cache and verify that your changes have taken effect.

    You should see your custom text on the login and home pages of OBIEE
    Analytics, as shown in the following images:

    ![A screenshot of the new banner text on the login
    page]({% asset_path 2018-08-30-obiee-2/picture7.png %})

    ![A screenshot of the new banner text on the home
    page]({% asset_path 2018-08-30-obiee-2/picture8.png %})

### Conclusion

After you've reviewed these tips and followed the steps outlined in this blog
post, your custom logo and text appears in OBIEE. We hope that these tips help
you better understand the user interface elements of OBIEE 11g and reduce the
amount of time it takes you to customize your environment.
