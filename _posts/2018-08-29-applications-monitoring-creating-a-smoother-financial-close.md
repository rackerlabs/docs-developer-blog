One of the key points in supporting our customers is to make sure they have a
smooth month-end closing process. Many people have issues that lead to a delay
in their monthly close.  Often, the issues causing these delays are not
identifiable and are hidden behind the scenes. To overcome this situation, we
have an applications monitoring process that helps unearth these hidden problems
and allows us to proactively address these even before it comes to our customers’
notice.

### Introduction

Let’s begin by understanding what application monitoring is all about.
Applications monitoring consists of scripts that can be scheduled, on cron, to
run nightly in our customers’ production environment to identify hidden problems.
These scripts monitor the standard Oracle&reg; transactional interfaces and
workflows and create a report that is emailed to a pre-defined distribution group
for review. These reports are reviewed, and if issues exist, our applications
support team fixes them.
