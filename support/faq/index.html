      <h3><a name="what_is" id="what_is"></a>What is the developer+ program?</h3>

      <p>developer+ is a program to introduce developers to Rackspace, the Rackspace Cloud, managed services,
        and Fanatical Support&reg; via developer-to-developer support. The program also helps developers to grow
        with Rackspace and to experience, first hand, the Managed Cloud.</p>

      <p>Fundamentally, the developer+ program is an incubator for your idea. It provides an Infrastructure Credit,
        and period of time, so you can experience the full portfolio of Rackspace's cloud and build out
        your idea or business. Want to test out an MVP web application? You can do that. How about Experience
        CoreOS + Docker? You can do that as well (our CoreOS images are updated weekly). We want to
        provide you with what you need to build out modern applications on the world's largest OpenStack&trade;
        powered cloud.</p>

      <p>Additionally, developer+ includes several direct feedback mechanisms (as part of the terms and conditions of
        signup) that allow our teams to get direct, honest feedback from customers. This is key to the development of
        the program.</p>

      <p>For additional information, see <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace-developer-program-for-developers-by-developers">the
        official announcement.</p>

      <h3><a name="included" id="included"></a>What is included in the developer+&trade; program?</h3>

      <p>Participants in the developer+ program:
         <ul>
           <li>receive an <strong>$50 infrastructure credit for 12 months</strong> that applies to all Rackspace Cloud services</li>
           <li>do not pay a Service Level Rate or Service level minimum. </li>
         </ul>

         In addition, developer+ customers have access to other great free cloud services, like:

         <ul>
           <li>Cloud DNS</li>
           <li>Cloud Orchestration</li>
           <li>Cloud Monitoring</li>
           <li>Cloud Networking</li>
           <li>Mailgun&trade; (first 50,000 emails free)</li>
        </ul>

        and more being added all the time!
      </p>
      <p>
        Some support options in the customer portal have been replaced for developer+ customers, such as
        one-to-one chat, support tickets, and the phone number. Tickets have been replaced with Billing Inquiries.</p>

      <p>As new products and services come online, they may be added to, and highlighted in, this program.</p>

      <h3><a name="identified" id="identified"></a>How is developer+ different than Managed Infrastructure/Operations?</h3>

      <p>Customers in the developer+ program are a part of the Managed Infrastructure service level, but developer+ have access to phone and ticket support for billing/account related issues only. Most of our developers are self supporting, or use our community resourcs like those detailed in a <a href="#support">How do I get support?</a></p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>


      <h3><a name="limited" id="limited"></a>Are the services rate limited?</h3>

      <p>No, any rate limits that apply are our documented default service limits for all Rackspace customers.
        We have not throttled, crippled, or otherwise made this a technically-inferior program for developers.</p>

      <p>You have complete access to all services and features.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="add_service" id="add_service"></a>What if developers want to add another server? Test a website or database?</h3>

      <p>developer+ customers can consume cloud at a "pay for what you consume" competitive prices for all services
        in any region. They can consume ObjectRocket&trade;, OnMetal&trade;, and everything else currently
        available to our other customers.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="upgrade" id="upgrade"></a>Can developer+ participants upgrade to another service level?</h3>

      <p>At any time, participants in the program may log into the Control Panel and upgrade to our Managed Cloud
        service levels. Customers may not, however, switch to developer+.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="existing" id="existing"></a>Can existing customers have their accounts moved to developer+?</h3>

      <p>Not at this time. Only new accounts can choose the developer+ program.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="billing" id="billing"></a>How are developer+ customers billed?</h3>

      <p>Customers in developer+ pay only for infrastructure they consume over $50 (30 GBP) each month for 12 months.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="expiration" id="expiration"></a>What happens at the end of 12 months?</h3>

      <p>Customers in developer+ will be contacted prior to the 12 month term completion to discuss upgrading to
        the Managed Infrastructure or Managed Operations service levels. By default, at the end of 12 months
        the Managed Infrastructure level will be applied including Service Level rates.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="slas" id="slas"></a>Are developer+ customers eligible for the SLA guarantees covered by Managed
        Infrastructure?</h3>

      <p>Yes, but their credit is reduced by 50 percent as noted in the Terms and Conditions.</p>

      <p><a href="#top">back to top</a></p>

      <h3><a name="difference" id="difference"></a>What is the difference between developer+ and the Startup Program?</h3>

      <p>developer+ offers a way for developers who are comfortable writing and deploying their code, and require
        minimal assistance, to use the Rackspace Cloud. </p>

      <p>The Rackspace Startup Program offers discounted infrastructure as a service, and it leverages Rackspaceâ€™s
        knowledge and experience in the business and technology communities to offer developing companies advice on
        how to best architect their product. The Startup Program also connects entrepreneurs to tools like
        ObjectRocket&trade; and Mailgun&trade;, and the program gives them access to guidance on their startup through our
        extensive network of startup and technology business professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
