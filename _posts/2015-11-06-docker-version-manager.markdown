New and exciting Docker services, such as [Carina][carina], are springing up right and left.
This is great but can introduce a new problem when each service may be using a
different version of Docker. Keeping track and switching between them can become juggling act.
But not anymore!

Docker Version Manager (dvm) is a cross-platform command-line tool that helps you install and
switch between Docker clients.

Let's install dvm and take it for as spin. Copy, paste, and run the commands from your
installation output to finalize the installation.

** Mac OS X and Linux **

```bash
$ curl -sL https://download.getcarina.com/dvm/latest/install.sh | sh
```

** Windows **

Open a PowerShell command prompt, and execute the following command. PowerShell
performs the initial installation but you can use dvm with PowerShell or CMD once installed.

```powershell
> iex (wget https://download.getcarina.com/dvm/latest/install.ps1)
```

Once installed, we can list all installed versions of the Docker client.

```bash
$ dvm ls
->  system (1.8.1)
```

Hmm, that's a bit old, so let's install a newer version of Docker.

```bash
$ dvm install 1.9.0
Installing 1.9.0...
Now using Docker 1.9.0

$ docker --version
Docker version 1.9.0, build 76d6bc9
```

Switching between versions is simple. In fact, if the requested version is not already
installed, dvm installs it for you.

```bash
$ dvm use 1.8.3
1.8.3 is not installed. Installing now...
Installing 1.8.3...
Now using Docker 1.8.3

$ docker --version
Docker version 1.8.3, build f4bf5c7
```

At any time, I can undo the changes that dvm has made to my current session. After
deactivating, I am back to using the system installation of the Docker client.

```bash
$ dvm deactivate
$ docker --version
Docker version 1.8.1, build d12ea79
```

Now, let's use dvm with Carina! First, I will load my cluster credentials.
Then dvm will use them to automatically detect the right version for my cluster.

** Mac OS X and Linux **

```bash
$ source mycluster/docker.env
$ dvm use
Now using Docker 1.8.3
```

** Windows PowerShell **

```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Unrestricted
> .\mycluster\docker.ps1
> dvm use
Now using Docker 1.8.3
```

You can also define an alias for a version, or use one of the built-in aliases
`system` and `experimental`. The `system` alias is used to switch to the system
installation of Docker and `experimental` is an alias for the latest, nightly Docker build.

```bash
$ dvm ls
->  1.8.3
    1.9.0
    experimental (1.10.0-dev, build c920895)
    system (1.8.1)

$ dvm use system
Now using system version of Docker: 1.8.1

$ dvm use experimental
Now using Docker experimental
```

So what are you waiting for? Stop juggling, and start using dvm today!
